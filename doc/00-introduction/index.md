# Spectra Docs


Spectra is a tool suite for organizational analytics. It was built in an academic 
environment for engineering capstone courses, but is intended to be more broadly 
applicable to any organization.

![Architecture overview](../99-architecture/diagrams/001-av1.drawio.png)

Spectra is designed to support data engineering, data science, and data ops
for large organizations consisting of many teams. The core use case for Spectra
is to easily distribute peer-based surveys to large numbers of teams and collect
and analyze those surveys without needing to stand up dedicated public-facing
infrastructure for authentication, data capture, and storage.
